<h2>Learn how Malala began her fight for girls- 
from an education activist in Pakistan to the youngest Nobel Peace Prize laureate- 
and how she continues her campaign through Malala Fund.</h2>
<p>
  As a young girl, Malala Yousafzai defied the Taliban in Pakistan and demanded that girls be allowed to receive an education.<br> She was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman in 2012 but survived.<br> In 2014, she became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
<br>Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani education advocate who, at the age of 17 in 2014, became the youngest person to win the Nobel Peace Prize after surviving an assassination attempt by the Taliban. Yousafzai became an advocate for girls' education when she herself was still a child, which resulted in the Taliban issuing a death threat against her. On October 9, 2012, a gunman shot Yousafzai when she was traveling home from school. She survived and has continued to speak out on the importance of education. In 2013, she gave a speech to the United Nations and published her first book, I Am Malala.
